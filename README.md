# FactuMatico
A little program I made for my mother.

The first actually useful program I ever put together.
It calculates the value of the tax for a product in a way that it is included
in the final price in a neatly rounded and cash friendly sum.

First it prompts the user for the days exchange rate, and uses it to return the prices
in local currency.

Then it goes about it backwards, by first taking the final price of the product
and then returning the price the item should have for the taxes to take it
to the price its being sold at. 

It sure is quite the unintuitive situation and calculation,
thats why I decided to make this program and let it take care of this icky problem that 
was bound to lose us some money in a simple hand-held calculator mistake.

This was the first time I realized I could solve a real problem--a problem that I had-- 
using a computer. No games, no social media, no cat pictures. A skill I had learned on a whim 
and a few lines of code saved us time, effort, and a potential legal issue.

Also ink and paper.

Theres no technical prowess here to show off. 
But I consider there to be meaning in this simple little program.
